# Code-refactor-assignment

Refactor code for a webpage to increase accessiblility as well as reorginizing the HTML/CSS code. 

The refactored site is a Webpage for the Horiseon homepage describing the benifits for search engine optimaization (SEO).

To refactor the site, old html tags consisting of divs with classes were changed to more semantically descriptive tags and the CSS selectors connected with them. Changed following tags and their selectors:
    -header
    -nav
    -main
    -article
    -aside
    -footer

First nav link was repaired to correctly point to intended destination.

Alt descriptions added to images.

CSS file was condensed from 200 lines to 153, while adding comments, lines by removing redundant sections as well as combining a few classes, which all had the same properties, into one single class.

Added comments to HTML and CSS.
